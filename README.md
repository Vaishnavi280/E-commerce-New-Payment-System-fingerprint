Developed Finger Print And Face Detection System for  E-coomerce  shopping
I have developed a security model for credit card verification using webcam and fingerprint authentication to provide high security that helps reduce online transaction fraud. The proposed system is integrated with a one-way security module, fingerprint verification, that can only be accessed by an authorized user to protect users from online transactions. This program will help to promote online transactions.
This project can be used in future by Credit/Debit Card companies increasing their security in the system and also we can add more layers of security in the system using Face Recognition or any Biometric Security which in turn make the system more secure. We can also add more powerful models in our system and make our system more robust and fraud proof.
